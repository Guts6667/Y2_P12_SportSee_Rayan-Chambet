## Goal

## Datas

      - `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
      - `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
      - `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).

Example of query:

    `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performance` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
